# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
**I'm Elvis (he/him)** - I'm an Aspiring Software Engineer who is currently enrolled at the University of the West of England, Bristol where I'm studying towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science (with Placement Year). 

Between my time at secondary school, college and university I have 7 years experience studying computer science based courses and have work experience as a Junior Software Developer Intern, which has allowed me develop my programming knowledge, skill and ability.
